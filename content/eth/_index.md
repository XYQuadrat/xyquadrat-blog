I'm currently studying Computer Science at ETH Zurich. Here you'll find a few resources I've created since I started here:

* The [Ersti FAQ](@/infk-faq/_index.md) with lots of commonly asked questions by new students
* The [Exam FAQ](@/2021-12-23-eth-exam-faq.md)
* The [A&D personal resource page (german)](@/eth/and.md) that has links to materials I used for my exercise sessions
* The [eth-cheatsheets repository](https://github.com/xyquadrat/eth-cheatsheets) that hosts my LaTeX cheatsheets

I hope you find them useful - if you do, a mail or text saying thanks is worth more than any money you could give me. Like basically everything that I do, these resources are open source, which means that you can easily contribute to them on [GitHub](https://github.com/xyquadrat/xyquadrat-blog).
