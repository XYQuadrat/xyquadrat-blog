In practice, it is highly recommended that you visit all exercise sessions for all courses.<h3 id=do-i-have-to-do-the-bonus-exercises>Do I have to do the bonus exercises?</h3><p>Again, in principle, no. You can achieve a 6.0 in every subject (apart from Digital Design and Computer Architecture, where you have labs that account for 30% of your final grade) without doing any bonus exercises. That said, there is a correlation between having many bonus points and in total doing well at the exam; so do all bonus exercises.<h3 id=do-i-need-a-tablet-to-take-notes>Do I need a tablet to take notes?</h3><p>No, but it can be helpful for organization. Some people like digital notetaking, others don’t. A tablet is definitely not necessary, but get one if you like the workflow.<h3 id=what-operating-system-is-best-for-our-studies>What operating system is best for our studies?</h3><p>All major three operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux derivatives) work well. (If you plan on using TempleOS or Haiku, you might encounter some difficulties though.) In the second semester you will have Digital Design and Computer Architecture Labs in which you use a (horrible) software called <a href=https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html rel=noopener target=_blank>Vivado</a> to program an FPGA. Vivado does not run on macOS, but you will work together with a partner, so if your partner has either Windows or Linux, this should not be a problem. Otherwise you can use a VM.<h3 id=do-i-need-to-stick-with-my-exercise-group-ta>Do I need to stick with my exercise group / TA?</h3><p>No. It is in fact recommended that you attend a different exercise session if you struggle with your TA. You generally still have to hand in bonus exercises to the TA you originally chose, but otherwise you are more or less free to switch TAs at any time. A good TA can make a big difference for your understanding of the subjects, so don’t put up with a bad TA for too long.<h3 id=do-i-have-to-pay-attention-in-introduction-to-programming-if-i-can-already-program>Do I have to pay attention in “Introduction to Programming” if I can already program?</h3><p>If you already are able to program in any mainstream language, “Introduction to Programming” (eProg) will be a lot easier. Still, do not take the course too lightly. There are various topic that can present a challenge even to experienced programmers (Java polymorphism subtleties, EBNF, …). Thus, do the bonus exercises for sure and do not underestimate that you most likely need to put at least some time into learning the more advanced theory parts.<h3 id=should-i-be-doing-coding-projects-in-my-free-time>Should I be doing coding projects in my free time?</h3><p>You don’t <em>need</em> to do coding projects in your free time, but it can be a lot of fun! It might not help you much with your studies directly, but you will profit either way.<h3 id=i-heard-about-these-gess-courses-do-i-have-to-take-them-already>I heard about these GESS courses. Do I have to take them already?</h3><p>For those that don’t know, GESS stands for “Geistes-, Sozial-, und Staatswissenschaften”, and these courses are complementary subjects covering a wide range of topics that you can freely choose from. Generally you can ignore additional courses in Basisjahr (GESS are just one type of additional courses). You will eventually need to take GESS courses worth 6 credits, but most people do this starting in the third semster. If you are repeating, you can take one if you want to.<h3 id=what-are-the-courses-i-have-in-the-first-year-about>What are the courses I have in the first year about?</h3><p><em>1. Semester</em><ul><li><strong>Introduction to Programming:</strong> You learn how to program in Java, including how object-oriented programming works. This most likely also includes drawing a swiss flag, something called “EBNF” and a guessing game that you can spend hours on optimizing.<li><strong>Discrete Mathematics:</strong> You learn how to prove stuff, why it is impossible to write a program that detects all malware, what rings and fields in mathematics are and how some applications of those (RSA, Error correcting codes) work. Throughout the course you will sometimes hear about the ominous “Chapter 6” which, once you get to it, turns out to be not very ominous at all.<li><strong>Linear Algebra:</strong> You learn about matrices and how to use them to solve systems of linear equations. Sounds straightforward, but it turns out there are many different approaches on how to do this efficiently.<li><strong>Algorithms & Datastructures:</strong> You learn how to design programs and datastructures that can solve problems efficiently, ranging from sorting over searching to graph problems. Likely includes tips on <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem rel=noopener target=_blank>how to steal stuff as efficiently as possible</a>.</ul><p><em>2.Semester</em><ul><li><strong>Analysis I:</strong> What some at the start believe to be only a repetition of what they already learned at Gymnasium turns out to be a rigorous approach to Analysis. You’ll learn about sequences, series, functions, derivatives and integral - whilst in principle nothing new for most students, the attention to the “why?” can still make this rather challenging.<li><strong>Algorithms & Probability:</strong> The continuation of Algorithms & Datastructures, but now with added randomness. Learn how to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test rel=noopener target=_blank>check if a number is probably prime</a>, how to find duplicates quickly and something called “maxflow-mincut” (trust me, you’ll like these coding exercises). Potentially you’ll even get to know the legendary football player “Messaldo”.<li><strong>Parallel Programming:</strong> You learn how to use all the cores in your system and the many problems that arise when trying to do so. Interestingly enough, in FS21 this lecture was actually streamed on Twitch due to the Covid-19 situation.<li><strong>Digital Design and Computer Architecture:</strong> Explore how a computer works under the hood and what hardware engineers do to make it go faster. You will also program an FPGA in the labs which will be part of your final grade. The professor, Onur Mutlu, calls this a “high-bandwidth lecture”, and he’s certainly not wrong.</ul><h3 id=i-m-a-foreign-student-do-you-have-recommendation-on-must-have-apps-in-switzerland-zurich>I’m a foreign student. Do you have recommendation on must-have apps in Switzerland/Zurich?</h3><p>(Most of the next two sections was contributed by Lukas, and some more apps were suggested by Fabian. Thanks!)<ul><li>SBB Mobile - The main app for public transport in Switzerland.<li>Covid Certificate - You can save & show your covid certificate here.<li>SwissCovid - The Swiss Covid contact tracing app.<li>AlertSwiss - Can send you warnings and other civil protection-related news.<li>MeteoSwiss - Generally regarded as one of the best weather apps in Switzerland.<li>Swisstopo - The absolute best maps for Switzerland if you want to go hiking, fly drones or just find out where something is.<li>TooGoodToGo - Want cheap good food? This is an app where you can buy leftovers from restaurants at a very reduced price.<li>PubliBike - Rent bikes temporarily for a low price. <a href=https://ethz.ch/studierende/de/campus/transport-mobilitaet/velo.html rel=noopener target=_blank>ETH also offers a special deal</a> that gives you a year-long subscription for 70CHF where you can use the bikes to ride up to 30 minutes for free.</ul><h3 id=i-saw-eth-also-has-a-few-apps-what-are-those-for>I saw ETH also has a few apps. What are those for?</h3><ul><li>EduApp - Used for clicker questions during lectures and to ask questions in some courses. Also includes a campus map and a not very helpful schedule.<li>ETH Zurich - Used for checking the Mensa menu, primarily. Also has a campus map and a general ETH news feed.<li>ASVZ - If you want to view and enroll in sports offerings from ASVZ, this is the app to do it.</ul><h3 id=in-algorithms-datastructures-the-tests-on-code-expert-pass-but-when-i-submit-i-get-wrong-answer-why>In Algorithms & Datastructures: The tests on Code Expert pass, but when I submit I get “Wrong Answer”. Why?</h3><p>Passing local test cases (these get run when you click the bottle) is not the same as getting full points when submitting. When you submit, your code is tested with hidden test cases, which are much more extensive than the local test cases and potentially include edge cases the local ones don’t.<h3 id=i-feel-really-overwhelmed-i-m-in-a-bad-spot-mentally-or-i-just-don-t-know-how-to-handle-the-load-what-to-do>I feel really overwhelmed, I’m in a bad spot mentally or I just don’t know how to handle the load. What to do?</h3><p>It’s super important that you get help. You don’t have to and shouldn’t go through a difficult time alone. ETH offers various ways to support you. One great option is the <a href=https://www.nightline.ch rel=noopener target=_blank>Nightline</a>. You can call or chat with them most of the time throughout the week, and it’s fully anonymous. They aren’t professionals though. If you feel professional help is needed, do not hesitate to contact the <a href=https://www.pbs.uzh.ch/de.html rel=noopener target=_blank>Psychologische Beratungsstelle</a>. There are also further options listed on <a href=https://ethz.ch/studierende/de/beratung/studium-und-gesundheit/kontakte-gesundheit.html rel=noopener target=_blank>this page</a>. Again, please take care of yourself and do not wait for too long until you seek external help & advice.<h3 id=should-i-join-polyring>Should I join Polyring?</h3><p>If you have a blog, definitely! Polyring is a webring / community of blogs from ETH members. It will boost the visibility of your blog posts and might also encourage you to blog more.
